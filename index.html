          In January 1940 in Ivano-Frankivsk the preparation for the first
          Prykarpattya higher educational institution (Teachers Institute) was
          opened. The Institute is housed in an unfinished premises of the trade
          school. However, these did not prevent the inconvenience find space
          for classes, and assembly, and for groups of amateur performances,
          which were organized immediately Institute was opened with three
          faculties, one of which was the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics.
          Faculty was relatively small (the reason is not only the lack of
          suitable premises, but a lack of trained applicants). The first set of
          students was completed February 27, 1940, and training was began in
          March. In the first months of the work of faculty especially a lot of
          effort and energy has made by the first dean â€“ Mykola Korol.

                implements the Model-View-Controller architectural template for

                on his work at 37signals on the Basecamp project management tool

              <p>
                Tools for managing isolated Linux containers. Docker complements
                the LXC toolkit with a higher-level API that allows you to
                manage containers at the isolation level of individual
                processes. In particular, Docker allows you to run the arbitrary
                processes in isolation mode without worrying about the contents
                of the container and then transfer and clone the containers
                formed for these processes to other servers, taking on all the
                work of creating, maintaining and maintaining containers.

          <p>
            Developed project - blog. Where users can create articles, share
            them with other people, and read / view other people's articles. The
            development process included several stages:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1) Set up of the project</li>
            <li>2) Development of authorization / login system</li>
            <li>3) Development ofCRUD system</li>
            <li>4) Integration of AWS S3 Bucket;</li>
            <li>5) Development of a system of likes.</li>
            <li>6) Integration of the project into the docker.</li>
            <li>7) Development of searching and filtering functionality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The project used the object-relational database Postgres, the
            development of the front-end part was carried out using the erb
            library, which is used to implement the code in Html layout. The
            above-mentioned technologies were also used in the projects
